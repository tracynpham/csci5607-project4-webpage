    <h2>difficulties i encountered</h2>
        <p id="difficulties">
            i turned this project 3 days late because of a mismatch between how i was rendering my cube model and how i did the math inside my collistion detection. 
            i lost 3+ days of debugging down to one fix in my code: shifting all the cubes by 0.5f... it was so frustrating diminishing my grade 20% because of one small bug. 
            but shoutout stephen for sitting down and fixing it with me.
            i think OpenGL and SDL rendering were very straightforward so i didn't have a problem with that. things like doors and keys were actually fun to code the logic for.
